Bayview Municipal Services App

Project Overview
The Bayview Municipal Services App is a Windows Forms application designed to digitise citizen services for the Bayview Metropolitan Municipality. The system allows residents to report municipal issues, view announcements, and track the status of service requests. Employees can manage reported issues and mark them as resolved once addressed.
This project demonstrates role-based authentication, simple in-memory data storage, and an interactive GUI with modern design principles.
